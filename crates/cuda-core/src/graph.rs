//! CUDA graph capture and replay (RAII), **exploratory**.
//!
//! This module exists to find out what a safe graph API can and cannot promise.
//! It wraps the smallest useful slice of the graph surface — stream capture,
//! instantiation, replay — and records, in prose next to each item, which
//! obligations the type system discharges and which it merely documents.
//!
//! # Why bother
//!
//! Graph replay is worth a fixed ~1 µs per launch. Measured on this repo's
//! benchmark harness (RTX A2000, sm_86, 500 iterations):
//!
//! ```text
//! path    direct P50   graph P50   saved    nodes   µs/node
//! FP16    3.867 ms     3.697 ms    0.170    173     0.98
//! INT8    4.670 ms     4.491 ms    0.179    222     0.81
//! W8A16   9.180 ms     9.002 ms    0.178    293     0.61
//! ```
//!
//! The saving is near-constant while node counts differ by 70%, which is what
//! identifies it as per-launch overhead rather than anything kernel-related.
//!
//! # What the types actually enforce
//!
//! **Capture must be terminated even when it fails.** This is the obligation
//! most easily missed and the main reason to prefer a guard. The driver
//! documents that after an error, the stream enters
//! `CU_STREAM_CAPTURE_STATUS_INVALIDATED` and
//!
//! > The capture sequence must be terminated with `cuStreamEndCapture` on the
//! > stream where it was initiated in order to continue using `hStream`.
//!
//! So an early return or panic between begin and end leaves the stream
//! permanently unusable — and, because a capturing blocking stream also puts
//! the legacy null stream in "an unusable state", it can take the default
//! stream down with it. [`StreamCapture`] terminates in [`Drop`], so unwinding
//! cannot poison the stream.
//!
//! **Replays of one executable graph are serialised.** [`GraphExec::launch`]
//! takes `&mut self`. Two concurrent replays of the same `CUgraphExec` are not
//! permitted, and `&mut` is exactly that constraint, checked at compile time
//! rather than documented.
//!
//! # What the types do NOT enforce — read before relying on this
//!
//! **Captured graphs freeze device pointers, and nothing here ties their
//! lifetimes together.** Capture records the *argument values* that were
//! enqueued, including raw device addresses. If a buffer used during capture is
//! dropped while a [`GraphExec`] built from that capture is still alive, replay
//! dereferences freed device memory. There is no borrow relating the two:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let exec = {
//!     let scratch = DeviceBuffer::<f32>::new(&ctx, n)?;   // dropped here
//!     let capture = stream.begin_capture(CaptureMode::Global)?;
//!     launch_using(&scratch)?;
//!     capture.end()?.instantiate()?
//! };
//! exec.launch(&stream)?;   // use-after-free; compiles today
//! ```
//!
//! **Measured, not assumed** (`tests/graph_capture.rs`, the `--ignored` probe, on
//! an RTX A2000). The driver does not diagnose this, and the result looks right:
//!
//! ```text
//! launch    = Ok(())
//! sync      = Ok(())
//! read      = Ok(())
//! dst       = [7, 8, 9, 10]   (captured source was [7, 8, 9, 10])
//! diagnosed = false
//! ```
//!
//! The replay read freed device memory that still happened to hold the old
//! bytes, so the copy "succeeded". That is the worst available failure mode: it
//! passes in testing and corrupts once the freed pages are reused, with no error
//! at launch, at synchronize, or on read-back. Stream-ordered deallocation
//! returning memory to a pool rather than the driver makes this the *likely*
//! presentation, not a rare one.
//!
//! Expressing the constraint would require the exec to borrow every buffer
//! touched during capture, which the capture API cannot observe — the driver
//! sees pointer values, not Rust borrows. Options, none free: thread a lifetime
//! through a capture-scope closure that owns the buffers; make graphs own `Arc`
//! clones of their inputs; or make `instantiate` unsafe with this as its
//! documented obligation. Given that the failure is silent, the last is probably
//! the honest default for a safety-positioned crate. **This module leaves the
//! hole open and named rather than papering over it**, because choosing among
//! those is a design decision, not an implementation detail.
//!
//! Also not modelled, deliberately: graphs containing memory allocation nodes
//! (the driver permits at most one live exec per graph in that case), device
//! launch, and node mutation. Mutation in particular interacts with launch
//! contracts — see the note on [`GraphExec`].
