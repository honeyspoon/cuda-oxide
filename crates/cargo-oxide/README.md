# cargo-oxide

Cargo subcommand for building and running Rust GPU programs with cuda-oxide.

Replaces the previous `xtask` pattern with a proper cargo subcommand that works both inside the cuda-oxide repo (for developers) and externally (for users who `cargo install`).

## Installation

**Internal developers** (inside the cuda-oxide repo): no installation needed. The workspace alias makes `cargo oxide` work immediately.

**External users**:

Install with the project's pinned nightly toolchain:

```bash
cargo +nightly-2026-04-03 install --git https://github.com/NVlabs/cuda-oxide.git cargo-oxide
```

On first run, `cargo-oxide` will automatically fetch and build the codegen backend if it's not already available.

## Usage

```bash
cargo oxide new my_project          # scaffold a new cuda-oxide project
cargo oxide new my_project --async  # scaffold with async template (tokio + cuda-async)
cargo oxide run vecadd              # build + run an example
cargo oxide build vecadd            # compile only (no run)
cargo oxide emit-ltoir vecadd --arch sm_100  # device code -> .ltoir (Tile/SIMT interop)
cargo oxide build -- -p my_app      # arbitrary cargo build through cuda-oxide
cargo oxide test                    # cargo test with cuda-oxide defaults
cargo oxide test -- -p my_app       # arbitrary cargo test through cuda-oxide
cargo oxide pipeline vecadd         # verbose pipeline dump
                                    # (MIR -> dialect-mir -> LLVM dialect -> LLVM IR -> PTX)
cargo oxide debug vecadd --tui      # build + launch cuda-gdb
cargo oxide fmt                     # format all crates
cargo oxide fmt --check             # check formatting
cargo oxide doctor                  # validate environment
cargo oxide setup                   # explicitly build the codegen backend
```

`--arch` is required for `emit-ltoir` and explicit NVVM IR output because those
artifacts are architecture-specific. Without an override, `run` detects the
local GPU, while `build` and `pipeline` use the compiler's feature-based target
so they remain useful for cross-compilation.

`--no-fmad` disables FMA contraction for kernels that rely on two separate
roundings (e.g. Dekker's algorithm, 2Sum). Equivalent to `CUDA_OXIDE_NO_FMA=1`.
By default, FMA contraction is on (matching nvcc's `--fmad=true`): `fmul+fadd`
pairs fuse into a single `fma.rn.f32` for fewer instructions and one rounding.

## Commands

### `cargo oxide run <example>`

Builds the codegen backend, compiles the example with the custom backend, and runs it. This is the primary command for day-to-day development.

When neither `--arch` nor `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET` is set, `run` detects the
compute capability of CUDA device 0 and targets that architecture so the
generated PTX can load on the local GPU. Use `--arch <sm_XXX>` or
`CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET=<sm_XXX>` to override this for a specific device or
cross-target workflow.

```bash
cargo oxide run vecadd
cargo oxide run gemm_sol
cargo oxide run device_ffi_test --emit-nvvm-ir --arch sm_120
cargo oxide run cutile_inter_kernel
```

Interop examples can declare extra cuda-oxide device crates with
`[[package.metadata.cuda-oxide.device-crates]]`, plus optional
`[package.metadata.cuda-oxide.interop]` metadata. `cargo oxide run` builds those
device crates with `rustc-codegen-cuda`, writes their PTX to the
configured location, and then builds/runs the host crate normally.
`cutile_inter_kernel` uses this path:
the host crate is a cutile-rs program, while `simt/` is a cuda-oxide SIMT PTX
crate loaded by the host at runtime.

### `cargo oxide build <example>`

Same as `run` but stops after compilation. Useful for examples that require hardware you don't have (e.g., Blackwell tensor cores).

```bash
cargo oxide build htens          # compiles PTX, doesn't try to run on GPU
cargo oxide build tcgen05        # sm_100a only, but PTX generation works anywhere
```

`build` also has a passthrough mode for normal Cargo workspaces. Put the Cargo
arguments after `--`; cargo-oxide supplies the backend, target architecture,
configured environment, and optional device owner filters.

```bash
cargo oxide build --                           # plain `cargo build`
cargo oxide build --arch sm_86 -- -p my_app --bin app --release
cargo oxide build --cargo-target-dir target/cuda -- -p my_app --release
cargo oxide build --device-codegen-crate gpu-kernels,math_gpu -- -p my_app
```

The owner filter is matched against rustc crate names, so Cargo package hyphens
are normalized to underscores (`gpu-kernels` matches `gpu_kernels`). The CUDA
backend still compiles host code for every crate through LLVM; it emits device
artifacts only for the listed owner crates.

The filter controls compilation, not runtime module names. Code in an excluded
crate or target must not call that target's generated `load()` function. In a
package with several targets, embedded bundles still use the package name, so
an excluded target's loader could otherwise find a selected sibling target's
bundle.

Passthrough builds include the effective codegen settings and backend build in
Cargo's rustc fingerprint. Changing the target, output mode, FMA policy, owner
list, configured codegen environment, or backend `.so` therefore regenerates
device artifacts instead of reusing a stale Cargo result.

### `cargo oxide emit-ltoir <crate>`

Compiles a crate's device code to a binary LTOIR artifact in one step, for the
Tile-to-SIMT interop workflow ([#96](https://github.com/NVlabs/cuda-oxide/issues/96)):
cuda-oxide is the SIMT participant, producing LTOIR that a tile or CUDA C++ kernel
links against. It builds the crate in NVVM IR mode, then runs the emitted
`<crate>.ll` through libNVVM `-gen-lto`, writing `<crate>.ltoir`.

`--arch` is required, since LTOIR is architecture-specific. It accepts `sm_XX`,
`compute_XX`, or a bare `XX`. The default output path is `<crate-dir>/<crate>.ltoir`;
`-o/--output` overrides it.

```bash
cargo oxide emit-ltoir standalone_device_fn --arch sm_100
cargo oxide emit-ltoir my_simt_crate --arch sm_120 -o build/simt.ltoir
```

cuda-oxide chooses the NVVM IR format from the selected architecture.
Pre-Blackwell targets use LLVM 7 typed pointers; `compute_100` and newer targets
use modern opaque pointers. The target is checked before export and recorded
alongside the artifact so the runtime uses the same format.

### `cargo oxide test`

Runs `cargo test` through the cuda-oxide backend. With no extra arguments it
runs the workspace's normal test selection. Put Cargo test arguments after
`--`, including the test-binary separator when needed.

```bash
cargo oxide test
cargo oxide test -- -p my_app --release --test gpu_smoke -- --nocapture
cargo oxide test --device-codegen-crate gpu_smoke -- -p my_app --test gpu_smoke
```

### `cargo oxide pipeline <example>`

Shows verbose progress plus the selected IR artifacts: MIR collection,
`dialect-mir` before and after `mem2reg`, LLVM dialect, LLVM IR, and final PTX.

```bash
cargo oxide pipeline vecadd
cargo oxide pipeline device_ffi_test --emit-nvvm-ir --arch sm_120
```

### `cargo oxide debug <example>`

Builds with debug info (`-C debuginfo=2`) and launches cuda-gdb. Supports `--tui` for GDB's TUI mode and `--cgdb` for the cgdb frontend.

### `cargo oxide new <name> [--async]`

Scaffolds a new standalone cuda-oxide project with `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and a working `src/main.rs` containing a vector addition kernel. The default template uses `#[cuda_module]` with typed synchronous launch methods; `--async` generates a template with `tokio`, `cuda-async`, and typed lazy `DeviceOperation` launches.

```bash
cargo oxide new my_kernel
cd my_kernel
cargo oxide run
```

### `cargo oxide fmt [--check]`

Formats all crates in the workspace: root workspace, `rustc-codegen-cuda`, and all examples. With `--check`, reports files that need formatting without modifying them.

### `cargo oxide doctor`

Validates that your environment is correctly set up: Rust nightly toolchain,
CUDA headers (`cuda.h`), CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`, libNVVM, nvJitLink,
libdevice), LLVM (`llc`), clang/libclang, the NVIDIA driver / GPU, and the
codegen backend `.so`. Every check reports what was found or how to fix it.

`cargo-oxide` itself builds and runs without the CUDA toolkit and without an
NVIDIA driver, and `doctor` never builds anything first, so it works on a
bare machine and tells you exactly what is missing. The driver / GPU check is
informational (only `cargo oxide run` needs a GPU), and a missing backend
`.so` just points at `cargo oxide setup` (`run`/`build` build it on demand
anyway).

### `cargo oxide setup`

Explicitly builds (or rebuilds) the codegen backend. Normally this happens automatically on every `run`/`build`/`pipeline` command, but `setup` is useful after pulling new changes or for CI.

## Backend Discovery

When `cargo oxide` needs the `librustc_codegen_cuda.so` backend, it searches in this order:

1. **`CUDA_OXIDE_BACKEND` env var** — explicit path override
2. **Project config** — `.cargo/cuda-oxide.toml`
3. **Local repo** — detects `crates/rustc-codegen-cuda` relative to workspace root, builds from source
4. **Cached `.so`** — checks `~/.cargo/cuda-oxide/librustc_codegen_cuda.so`
5. **Auto-fetch** — clones the cuda-oxide repo, builds, and caches (one-time)

Project config can also provide the default architecture, extra rustc flags,
and child-process environment:

```toml
backend = "/path/to/librustc_codegen_cuda.so"
default-arch = "sm_86"
extra-rustflags = ["--cfg", "my_device_cfg"]

[env]
MY_BUILD_FLAG = "1"
```

Relative backend paths are resolved from the `.cargo` directory containing the
config file. Each `extra-rustflags` array element remains one rustc argument,
including values that contain spaces.

Configuration values are defaults. Precedence is:

1. explicit `cargo oxide` flags and internal artifact paths;
2. environment variables inherited by `cargo oxide`;
3. `.cargo/cuda-oxide.toml` defaults.

Do not put `RUSTFLAGS` or `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` in the `[env]` table; use
`extra-rustflags` for project defaults. cargo-oxide combines configured flags,
inherited user flags, explicit `--device-cfg` values, and its required compiler
flags in boundary-preserving `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`. Required compiler flags
are applied last so inherited settings cannot replace the cuda-oxide backend or
disable its correctness-critical codegen options.
