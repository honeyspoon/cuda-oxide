//! DisjointSlice - a type-safe abstraction for parallel GPU writes.
//!
//! This module provides `DisjointSlice<T>`, which guarantees that each thread
//! accesses a unique element, preventing data races.
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! Safety is enforced through the type system and bounds checking:
//!
//! 1. **ThreadIndex**: Can only be constructed by `index_1d`,
//!    `index_2d::<S>`, or the unsafe `index_2d_runtime`, which derive
//!    the index from hardware built-in variables (`threadIdx`,
//!    `blockIdx`, `blockDim`) -- read-only special registers assigned
//!    by the runtime at kernel launch. The formula combines these into
//!    a scalar index per thread. 2D stride is encoded in the index
//!    space, so mixing const strides is rejected at compile time.
//!
//! 2. **`get_mut(idx)`**: Bounds-checked access via an explicit
//!    `ThreadIndex`. Returns `Option<&mut T>` — `None` for out-of-bounds
//!    threads.
//!
//! 3. **`get_mut_indexed()`**: One-call form that mints the witness and
//!    resolves it in a single shot. Available when the index space implements
//!    [`crate::thread::IndexFormula`] (i.e. `Index1D` or `Index2D<S>`).
//!
//! 4. **`get_unchecked_mut()`**: Unsafe escape hatch for performance-critical
//!    paths where bounds have been validated by other means.
//!
//! The unsafe boundary is pushed away from each access. A prepared launch proves
//! that the kernel's declared index domain matches its geometry; an unprepared
//! raw launch is unsafe and leaves that proof to the caller. Constructing a
//! `DisjointSlice` from raw memory is also unsafe.

/// A slice-like type that can only be accessed with thread-local indices.
///
/// # Safety Invariants
///
/// The type system enforces these invariants:
/// 1. Default access via `get_mut(ThreadIndex)` is bounds-checked and sound.
/// 2. `ThreadIndex` can only be created by trusted index functions
///    (`index_1d`, `index_2d::<S>`, `unsafe index_2d_runtime`), which
///    derive the index from hardware built-in variables -- read-only
///    special registers assigned by the runtime at launch.
/// 3. Each thread's `ThreadIndex` is unique within its index space when the
///    prepared launch contract matches that space. Raw launch callers must
///    uphold the same condition explicitly.
///
/// Each thread accesses a unique element, making parallel writes safe without
/// synchronization.
///
/// # Memory Layout
///
/// Internally, this is identical to a slice: `{ ptr: *mut T, len: usize }`
/// The safety comes from type-level enforcement and bounds checking.
///
/// # Soundness
///
/// `get_mut()` returns `Option<&mut T>`, making out-of-bounds access
/// impossible in safe code. The previous API (`get() -> &mut T`) relied on
/// the caller to check bounds externally; in release builds this was UB for
/// out-of-bounds indices — a soundness hole. The current design follows
/// `slice::get_mut()` / `slice::get_unchecked_mut()` from std: the safe
/// path is sound when reached through a prepared launch. Raw launch geometry
/// and the unchecked element accessor are explicit unsafe escape hatches.
///
/// The type is `Send` but NOT `Sync`: each GPU thread gets its own copy of
/// the struct (with the same backing pointer), then uses its unique
/// `ThreadIndex` to access a different element. Sharing `&DisjointSlice`
/// across threads is not meaningful.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cuda_device::{thread, DisjointSlice};
///
/// #[kernel]
/// pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
///     let idx = thread::index_1d();
///     let i = idx.get();
///     if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(idx) {
///         *c_elem = a[i] + b[i];
///     }
/// }
