//! Choosing a tile shape from a target memory transaction width.
//!
//! Transaction width is set by the alignment of the element type, so it is a
//! consequence of the data layout rather than something a kernel can request.
//! That makes the useful question the inverted one: *given* the width I want,
//! what does the tile shape have to be?
//!
//! CUTLASS reasons in exactly that direction when it picks a threadblock tile.
//! From a GEMM configuration in this repository's benchmark baseline:
//!
//! ```text
//! ThreadblockShape M=32 is the minimum for RowMajor A
//! with 128 threads x 8-element access.
//! ```
//!
//! Read as a derivation: a 128-bit transaction of f16 is 8 elements, 128 threads
//! then move 1024 elements per load, and against `K = 32` that forces
//! `M >= 1024 / 32 = 32`. Every step is arithmetic on the width, the element
//! size, and the launch shape - which is what this module computes.
//!
//! Everything here is `const`, so a plan can drive a `const` generic or sit in a
//! `const {}` assertion and turn a tile shape that cannot reach the intended
//! width into a compile error.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This answers "what shape does this width need". It does not decide whether
//! the width is *achievable*, which depends on the element type and, for loads,
//! on how the value is used.
//!
//! Measured on sm_86, with the element type 16-byte aligned throughout:
//!
//! ```text
//! how the element is used                     LDG          STG
//! never decomposed                            LDG.E.128    STG.E.128
//! lanes read, whole value assembled+stored    LDG.E x4     STG.E.128
//! lanes read, scalar stored                   LDG.E x4     STG.E
//! ```
//!
//! So `align` is a necessary condition, and for loads not a sufficient one:
//! touching individual lanes lets the optimiser split the local apart and load
//! the lanes separately whatever the alignment. Stores have no such condition.
//! A plan therefore describes the shape a width *needs*, not a width the kernel
//! is guaranteed to get - the data has to move as whole elements as well.
//! See the `vectorization` example for the alignment half.
